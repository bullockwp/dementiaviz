### Introduction

The statements above present an eminent challenge we are facing in this century. Despite its potential disastrous impacts on the society, little public attention and awareness have been placed in the disease.  

One of the reasons for the lack of public awareness is that the loss of memory is usually perceived as a normal process of ageing. In fact, it is an abnormality and could be a sign of Dementia, which leads to a progressive decline of cognitive functions. Unlike patients with cancers or heart diseases, people with dementia endure long-lasting symptoms and become heavily dependent on caregivers. As of now, dementia can't be prevented or cured, but the risks of developing it can be reduced and early intervention prepares the patients and those surrounding them for the progression of the disease.  

With the population structure shifting to become more aged, the prevalence of dementia will continue to rise in the short future, especially in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs). Currently, the estimated number of people with dementia in LMICs is @@ millions, and it is projected to reach @@ millions in 2050, which is approximate to @@ % increase. While in high-income countries (HICs), there are about @@ millions with a forecast of @ % increase to @@ millions in 2050.  

In LMICs, people have less access to health care services, including diagnosis of dementia, compared to those living in HICs. The diagnosis rates of dementia are commonly less than 10 % of the total pool of people with dementia in LMICs, while the diagnosis rates in HICs are in the range of @@ - @@ %.  

Currently, there are numerous global efforts leading by World Health Organization (WHO) to promote care for people with dementia, risk reduction and research for cures. Many HICs have national plans to tackle dementia in place, while other countries are developing their plans. Immense efforts are required to curb the epidemic of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. 


### Motivation

We will endeavour to find evidence and quantitative data to support the two statements mentioned in the beginning, which includes the following claims:

- the world’s population is ageing
- people living longer and healthier lives
- an increase in the number of people with non-communicable diseases, including dementia
- the world will shortly be confronted with the *epidemic* of the 21<sup>st</sup> century

Then, we will tell a story of the prevalence of dementia supported by interactive data visualisation. The objective would be to raise the public awareness of the disease by using engaging visual medium, which also allows them to further explore the data interactively.  

As people usually have emotion to place they have connection to (Boomsma, 2017), it is our intent to tell stories of some specific countries, e.g., Denmark (HIC), the UK (HIC),and Thailand (MIC).

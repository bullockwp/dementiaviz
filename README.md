----------------------------

>The world’s population is ageing. Improvements in health care in the past century have contributed to people living longer and healthier lives. However, this has also resulted in an increase in the number of people with non-communicable diseases, including dementia.

*Dr Margaret Chan (1947 - )*  
*Former Director-General of World Health Organization[<sup>1</sup>](#1)*  

>Unless we find ways to prevent or cure Alzheimer’s and other severe dementing diseases, the world will shortly be confronted with … the epidemic of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.

*Dr Robert Butler (1927 - 2010)*  
*Gerontologist, psychiatrist, and Pulitzer Prize winner[<sup>2</sup>](#2)*
